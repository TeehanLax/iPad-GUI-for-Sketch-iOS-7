# iPad GUI for Sketch (iOS 7)

These files were originally done exclusively for Photoshop, but with the huge
number of requests for a Sketch version, it only made sense that we offer it for
that too.

Sketch has come a long way since its first iteration. A forthcoming update to
Sketch 3 will include the assets from this fileâ€”right in the application! In the meantime, you can still download the file here for use inside of Sketch. Big thanks to the people at [Bohemian Coding](http://bohemiancoding.com/) for integrating them and to [Tyler Howarth](http://twitter.com/tylr) for porting
them.
